  # As we can see above, we specify the target name to be "bids" thanks to the target: "bids" option. By default, the target option will be equal to model_name.plural, which is equal to "bids" in the context of our Bid model. Thanks to this convention, we can remove the target: "bids" option:
  # The partial default value is equal to calling to_partial_path on an instance of the model, which by default in Rails for our Bid model is equal to "bids/bid".
  # The locals default value is equal to { model_name.element.to_sym => self } which, in in the context of our Bid model, is equal to { bid: self }.

  # after_create_commit -> { broadcast_prepend_later_to "bids" }
  # after_update_commit -> { broadcast_replace_later_to "bids" }
  # after_destroy_commit -> { broadcast_remove_to "bids" }


  # short hand for the above three line
